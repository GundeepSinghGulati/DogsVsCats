# DogsVsCats
It is a binary classification problem in which we need to identify whether it is a dog or cat. In this, I use a Kaggle dataset which contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Implement the CNN technique for classification and use Adam optimizer, which gives me good results and accuracy.
